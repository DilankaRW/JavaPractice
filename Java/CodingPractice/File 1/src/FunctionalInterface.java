// Create a functional interface
// An interface with exactly one abstract method is called a functional interface. The major benefit of functional interfaces is that you can use lambda expressions to instantiate them and avoid using bulky anonymous class implementation.

@java.lang.FunctionalInterface
interface FunctionalInterface {
    void test();
}
